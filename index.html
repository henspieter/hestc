                                                            and human society. The most noticeable ones are:</p>

                                                            on interdisciplinary methods in human ecological research was lectured at the universities of Lisbon (UNL)

                                                            introduction to the origin, history, scope and vision of this discipline. The core part focuses on 
                                                            health impact assessment and sustainable healthcare. Theory is complemented with a series of case studies.</li>

                                                            (related to the environment). The second part provides a series of real cases pointing to opportunities 
                                                            and problems on environment and tourism. The third part deals with international policy on the subject 
                                                            and introduces the instruments needed to implement this policy.</li>

							<p>My research interests are centered around “Interdisciplinary instruments for environmental management”. 
                                                            I did projects on EIA assessment, environmental management, life cycle analysis, sustainable development,
                                                            health impacts of increasing traffic flows both in Belgium and abroad. I am particularly interested in 
                                                            the fundamental aspects driving these instruments, their application and their policy implications.</p>
